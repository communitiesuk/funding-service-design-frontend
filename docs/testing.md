# Testing

## Unit & Accessibility Testing

To run all tests including aXe accessibility tests (using Chrome driver for Selenium) in a development environment run:

    pytest

The aXe reports are printed at /axe_reports


## Performance Testing

Performance tests are stored in a separate repository which is then run in the pipeline. If you want to run the performance tests yourself follow the steps in the README for the performance test repo located [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-performance-tests/blob/main/README.md)
