# FS-2193: In order to meet the "Label in name" accessibility standard,
# changes have been made to the form runner which allows us to hide the
# title and provide html in the label.
# See: https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-form-builder/pull/108

# This script will update the form jsons to use this new functionality,
# by adding a "hideTitle" property to the component options and moving
# the title into the hint.

# Doing so allows screen readers to read the label and hint together,
# which is the desired behaviour. The title styling is still applied.

# HOW TO USE:
#   python scripts/form_refactor_util.py mutation-key --dir form_jsons/public

# To add a new mutation, add a new key to this dictionary, the key is a unique
# identifier for the mutation, and the value is the function that will be
# called to perform the mutation. Please write a comment above the function
# describing what it does if you feel it is not obvious.

}

# To make sure your mutation works as expected, or to do test driven
# development, you can add input/expected json files to the
# tests/form_refactor_util directory.
