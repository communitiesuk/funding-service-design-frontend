Repo for the funding service design frontend.

Built with Flask.

## Prerequisites
- python ^= 3.10

# Getting started

## Installation

Clone the repository

### Create a Virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Enter the virtual environment

...either macOS using bash:

    source .venv/bin/activate

...or if on Windows using Command Prompt:

    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

### Install dependencies
From the top-level directory enter the command to install pip and the dependencies of the project

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to use
Enter the virtual environment as described above, then:

### Create static files

If your flask env is set to "development" then the static files will be built out automatically. If you
would like to manually download the static files then run

    python3 build.py

Developer note: If you receive a certification error when running the above command on macOS,
consider if you need to run the Python
'Install Certificates.command' which is a file located in your globally installed Python directory. For more info see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate)

Then run:

    flask run

A local dev server will be created on

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This is configurable in .flaskenv

You should see the following:

# Forms Engine Configuration

This service is designed to be coupled with XGov Form Builder for the serving of forms.
The end-to-end testing routines include tests that confirm the designated XGov Forms Runner
is correctly serving the appropriate forms.

To configure testing of a remote runner, set the FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST and FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST environment variable to the locations of the respective public and preview remote runners:

    export FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST="http://localhost:3009"
    export FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST="http://localhost:3009"

Form .json files generated by the XGov Forms Runner should be placed in the respective "public" or "preview" folders beneath the FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH which is by default /form_jsons in the root

    export FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH="form_jsons"

# Pipelines

Place brief descriptions of Pipelines here

* Deploy to Gov PaaS - This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate capabilities.  Builds, tests and deploys a simple python application to the PaaS for evaluation in Dev and Test Only.

# Testing

## Unit & Accessibility Testing

To run all tests including aXe accessibility tests (using Chrome driver for Selenium) in a development environment run:

...on macOS

    pytest --driver Chrome --driver-path .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/chromedriver_py/chromedriver_mac64

...on linux64

    pytest --driver Chrome --driver-path .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/chromedriver_py/chromedriver_linux64

...on win32

    pytest --driver Chrome --driver-path .venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/chromedriver_py/chromedriver_win32.exe

The aXe reports are printed at /axe_reports


## Performance Testing

Performance tests are stored in a separate repository which is then run in the pipeline. If you want to run the performance tests yourself follow the steps in the README for the performance test repo located [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-performance-tests/blob/main/README.md)


# Extras

This repo comes with a .pre-commit-config.yaml, if you wish to use this do
the following while in your virtual enviroment:

    pip install pre-commit black

    pre-commit install

Once the above is done you will have autoformatting and pep8 compliance built
into your workflow. You will be notified of any pep8 errors during commits.
