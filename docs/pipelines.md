# Pipelines

* Deploy to Gov PaaS - This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate capabilities.  Builds, tests and deploys a simple python application to the PaaS for evaluation in Dev and Test Only.
* Build and Deploy Forms - This builds the form runner (using `Dockerfile`) with the forms contained in `form_jsons` and deploys to dev (and on main, to test as well).
