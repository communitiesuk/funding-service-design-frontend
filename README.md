Repo for the funding service design frontend.

Built with Flask.

## Prerequisites
- python ^= 3.10

# Getting started

## Installation

Clone the repository

### Create a Virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Enter the virtual environment

...either macOS using bash:

    source .venv/bin/activate

...or if on Windows using Command Prompt:

    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

### Install dependencies
From the top-level directory enter the command to install pip and the dependencies of the project

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to use
Enter the virtual environment as described above, then:

### Create static files

    python build.py

Developer note: If you receive a certification error when running the above command on macOS,
consider if you need to run the Python
'Install Certificates.command' which is a file located in your globally installed Python directory. For more info see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate)

Then run:

    flask run

A local dev server will be created on

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This is configurable in .flaskenv
