Repo for the funding service design frontend.

Built with Flask.

## Prerequisites
- python ^= 3.10

# Getting started

## Installation

Clone the repository

### Create a Virtual environment

    python3 -m venv .venv

### Enter the virtual environment

...either macOS using bash:

    source .venv/bin/activate

...or if on Windows using Command Prompt:

    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

### Install dependencies

requirements-dev.txt and requirements.txt are updated using [pip-tools pip-compile](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
To update requirements please manually add the dependencies in the .in files (not the requirements.txt files)
Then run (in the following order):

    pip-compile requirements.in

    pip-compile requirements-dev.in

From the top-level directory enter the command to install pip and the dependencies of the project

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## How to use
Enter the virtual environment as described above, then:

### Create static files

If you would like to manually download the static files and extract them then run

    python3 build.py

Developer note: If you receive a certification error when running the above command on macOS,
consider if you need to run the Python
'Install Certificates.command' which is a file located in your globally installed Python directory. For more info see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate)

Then run:

    flask run

A local dev server will be created on

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This is configurable in .flaskenv

You should see the following:

# Forms Engine Configuration

This service is designed to be coupled with XGov Form Builder for the serving of forms.
The end-to-end testing routines include tests that confirm the designated XGov Forms Runner
is correctly serving the appropriate forms.

To configure testing of a remote runner, set the FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST and FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST environment variable to the locations of the respective public and preview remote runners:

    export FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST="http://localhost:3009"
    export FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST="http://localhost:3009"

Form .json files generated by the XGov Forms Runner should be placed in the respective "public" or "preview" folders beneath the FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH which is by default /form_jsons in the root

    export FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH="form_jsons"

# Pipelines

Place brief descriptions of Pipelines here

* Deploy to Gov PaaS - This is a simple pipeline to demonstrate capabilities.  Builds, tests and deploys a simple python application to the PaaS for evaluation in Dev and Test Only.

# Testing

## Unit & Accessibility Testing

To run all tests including aXe accessibility tests (using Chrome driver for Selenium) in a development environment run:

    pytest

The aXe reports are printed at /axe_reports


## Performance Testing

Performance tests are stored in a separate repository which is then run in the pipeline. If you want to run the performance tests yourself follow the steps in the README for the performance test repo located [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-performance-tests/blob/main/README.md)


# Extras

This repo comes with a .pre-commit-config.yaml, if you wish to use this do
the following while in your virtual enviroment:

    pip install pre-commit black

    pre-commit install

Once the above is done you will have autoformatting and pep8 compliance built
into your workflow. You will be notified of any pep8 errors during commits.
