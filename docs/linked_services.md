# Linked Services

## Forms Engine Configuration

This service is designed to be coupled with XGov Form Builder for the serving of forms.
The end-to-end testing routines include tests that confirm the designated XGov Forms Runner
is correctly serving the appropriate forms.

To configure testing of a remote runner, set the FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST and FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST environment variable to the locations of the respective public and preview remote runners:

    export FORMS_SERVICE_PUBLIC_HOST="http://localhost:3009"
    export FORMS_SERVICE_PREVIEW_HOST="http://localhost:3009"

Form .json files generated by the XGov Forms Runner should be placed in the respective "public" or "preview" folders beneath the FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH which is by default /form_jsons in the root

    export FORMS_SERVICE_JSONS_PATH="form_jsons"

The forms are designed to be used with the communititesuk fork of the XGovFormBuilder: https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-form-builder
- This pipeline builds and publishes new docker images from that repo: https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-form-builder/actions/workflows/dluhc-build-and-publish.yml
- They are published here: https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-form-builder/pkgs/container/digital-form-builder-dluhc-runner
- To use a new version of the fork of the form runner, update the `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` argument in `Dockerfile`.
